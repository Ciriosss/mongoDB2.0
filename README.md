# mongoDB2.0

this my prophet consists of an exchange platform, where it is possible to buy and see bitcoins.

I tried to reproduce as much as possible the operation of a real order book.

Upon registration, each user receives a random number of BTC from 1 to 10 with which he can start placing orders

the front-end of the site is very basic and intuitive
