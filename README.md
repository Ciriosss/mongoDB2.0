# mongoDB2.0

This my projcet consists in an exchange platform, where it is possible to buy and sell bitcoins.

I tried to reproduce as much as possible the operation of a real order book:
the platform can manage partial purchase and sale orders with all possible cases.
Users have the possibility for each order to see each of their orders whether it has been executed or not, and in the latter case, how much is still missing

At registration time registration, each user receives a random number of BTC from 1 to 10 with which he can start placing orders

the front-end of the site is very basic and intuitive
